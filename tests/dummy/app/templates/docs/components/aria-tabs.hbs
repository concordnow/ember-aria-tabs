# &lt;AriaTabs&gt;

The outer `<div />` of the tabs.

If you specify additional props on the `<AriaTabs />` component they will be forwarded to the rendered `<div />`.

Default CSS class: `ember-tabs`


## API

**defaultFocus**: *Boolean*

Defaults to `false`.

If set to `true` the tabs will be focused on initial render.
This allows immediate use of keyboard keys to switch tabs after the first render.

**defaultIndex**: *Number*

Defaults to `0`.

This allows changing the tab that should be open on initial render.
This is a zero-based index, so first tab is `0`, second tab is `1`, ...

> This can only be used in uncontrolled mode when react-tabs handles the current selected tab internally and for this reason cannot be used together with `selectedIndex`.
> See `controlled vs uncontrolled mode` for more info on modes.

**onSelect**: *Function*

Defaults to `null`.

This event handler is called every time a tab is about to change.
It will be called with the `index` that it will be changed to, the `lastIndex` which was selected before and the underlying `event` which is usually either a `keyup` or `click` event.
When `index` and `lastIndex` are equal it means the user clicked on the currently active tab.

The callback can optionally return `false` to cancel the change to the new tab.

> Returning `false` when the change to the new tab should be canceled is also important in controlled mode, as ember-aria-tabs still internally handles the focus of the tabs.

> In controlled mode the `onSelect` handler is a required prop.

**selectedIndex**: *Number*

Defaults to `null`.

Set the currently selected tab. This is a zero-based index, so first tab is `0`, second tab is `1`, ...

This enables controlled mode, which also requires `onSelect` to be set.
See `controlled vs uncontrolled mode` for more info on modes.

**selectedTabClassName**: *String*

Defaults to `"ember-tabs__tab--selected"`.

Provide a custom class name for selected tabs.

**selectedTabPanelClassName**: *String*

Defaults to `"ember-tabs__tab-panel--selected"`.

Provide a custom class name for selected panels.
